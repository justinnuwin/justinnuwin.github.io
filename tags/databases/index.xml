To facilitate me working at the national lab part-time during university I am contracted under J&amp;amp;A Film Preservation, a company that has been working with the Film Scanning and Re-Analysis Project for several years. I am continuing to develop vision algorithms for scientific measurements, but I am also working on streamlining our team&amp;rsquo;s workflow by using the latest workflow automation tools like Dagster.</description></item><item><title>NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)</title><link>https://www.justinnuwin.com/experience/jpl-2018/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.justinnuwin.com/experience/jpl-2018/</guid><description>After 1.5 years working at the Cal Poly CubeSat Lab I had the opportunity to intern at JPL to operate the MarCO CubeSats. MarCO is a pair of CubeSats that were launched with NASA&amp;rsquo;s InSight Lander with the mission to:
Relay InSight&amp;rsquo;s Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) data back to Earth in real-time Demonstrate the capabilities of the CubeSat form-factor in deep-space applications An interesting aspect of the MarCO mission is the level of involvement required due to systematic constraints on the mission.</description></item></channel></rss>
