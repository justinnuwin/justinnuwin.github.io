The Northrop Grumman Collaboration Project (NGCP) is a project-club at Cal Poly that participates in engineering challenges posed by Northrop Grumman. The collaboration project is with Northrop Grumman, in addition to Cal Poly Pomona with whom the work for the engineering challenge is split with. The 2019 school year had a new mission which was a rugged-terrain rescue mission. My peers and I were tasked with with sensing and intelligence for one of their new vehicles.</description></item></channel></rss>
