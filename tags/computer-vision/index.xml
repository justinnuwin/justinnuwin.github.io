The Northrop Grumman Collaboration Project (NGCP) is a project-club at Cal Poly that participates in engineering challenges posed by Northrop Grumman. The collaboration project is with Northrop Grumman, in addition to Cal Poly Pomona with whom the work for the engineering challenge is split with. The 2019 school year had a new mission which was a rugged-terrain rescue mission. My peers and I were tasked with with sensing and intelligence for one of their new vehicles.</description><content>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/justinnuwin/NGCP-Capstone-UGV">Github&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Shockwave analysis is one of the few methods used to determine the yield of a nuclear detonation.
To calculate the yield of these shots using the 1-D, spherical model developed by Taylor, an equivalent radius of the elliptical shockwave must be determined.
Armed with the digitized replicas of the original nuclear test films and the latest image processing tools, a methodology for segmenting the shockwave from the digitized film and measuring these shockwaves has been developed to quickly and accurately quantify the shape of these asymmetric shockwaves.
With a two-dimensional result from these asymmetric shockwaves, several methods are discussed to transform the final shockwave contour to an equivalent radius that can be used to determine the yield.&lt;/p>

&lt;figcaption class="center" >Optimized exposure LUTs derived from parameter search. First row contains the original cropped frames. The second row shows the waveforms (horizontal spectrogram) of the images in the first row. Middle row is the LUT's exposure curve. The final two rows are the adjusted frames and their respective waveforms.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The pipeline I developed provides was developed in Python using the OpenCV library and can detect and accurately measure the shockwave and fireball with minimal user input.
I utilized the high performance computing cluster at LLNL to perform parameter search over different exposures-adjusting look up tables which could be applied to a film to &amp;ldquo;boost&amp;rdquo; the fireball&amp;rsquo;s signal.&lt;/p>
