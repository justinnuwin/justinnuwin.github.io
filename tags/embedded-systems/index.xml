I am currently developing the C&amp;amp;DH flight software for IRIS, CMU&amp;rsquo;s Lunar Rover. The flight software uses NASA JPL&amp;rsquo;s F-Prime flight-software framework on top of FreeRTOS. The C&amp;amp;DH is a TI Hercules Safety-Microcontroller.

The USGS measures stream flows since they are critical for long-term tracking and modeling/forecasting to ensure that federal water priorities and responsibilities can be met and that the nation’s rivers canbe effectively managed. Recently, the USGS has been looking at non-contact methods of collection this data which would allow USGS scientists to gather data more safely and possibly without even going in to the field. One such method is large-scale particle image velocimetry (LS-PIV).</description></item><item><title>Cal Poly CubeSat Lab (PolySat)</title><link>https://justinnuwin.com/experience/polysat-2020/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://justinnuwin.com/experience/polysat-2020/</guid><description>Electrical Engineer 2016 - 2020
