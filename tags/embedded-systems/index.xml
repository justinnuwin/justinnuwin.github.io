I am currently developing the C&amp;amp;DH flight software for IRIS, CMU&amp;rsquo;s Lunar Rover. The flight software uses NASA JPL&amp;rsquo;s F-Prime flight-software framework on top of FreeRTOS. The C&amp;amp;DH is a TI Hercules Safety-Microcontroller.

The USGS measures stream flows since they are critical for long-term tracking and modeling/forecasting to ensure that federal water priorities and responsibilities can be met and that the nation’s rivers canbe effectively managed. Recently, the USGS has been looking at non-contact methods of collection this data which would allow USGS scientists to gather data more safely and possibly without even going in to the field. One such method is large-scale particle image velocimetry (LS-PIV).</description><content>&lt;p>&lt;a href="#">Bitbucket &lt;strong>not currently public&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

Recently, the USGS has been looking at non-contact methods of collection this data which would allow USGS scientists to gather data more safely and possibly without even going in to the field.
One such method is large-scale particle image velocimetry (LS-PIV).
LS-PIV is a special case of algorithms that perform optical flow; at its is a cross correlation operation which is expensive in both time complexity and energy usage.
My peers and I optimize the PIV algorithm to run on a 32-bit embedded microcontroller that can quickly and accurately perform the PIV computation and have a battery life of up to 2 years.&lt;/p>
