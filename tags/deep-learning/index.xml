ASR is used heavily in eyes-busy or hands-busy situations and often time the user may be speaking over noise. My peers and I are particularly interested in how music effects ASR decoding. We use several music datasets of varied genre or broken-down instrumentation to allow us to perform in-depth anaysis of how different aspects of music influences speech recognizer&amp;rsquo;s performance. We then train a new model from what we have learned to see if we could improve the original model&amp;rsquo;s performance.</description></item></channel></rss>
