I started as an intern at LLNL, click here to learn more about what I did then (and still do now)
In the meantime some of the things I have done so far are:
Manage data collection, storage, and visualization for the Film Scanning and Re-Analysis Project Architect object detection pipeline utilizing spectral analysis, temporal edge tracking, and exposure analysis of images Develop image processing GUI tools utilizing TK using Python and OpenCV Implement statistical methods to automatically check measurement data for quality Building data-driven image processing models to further automate accurate film measurements Stay tuned for updates!</description></item></channel></rss>
