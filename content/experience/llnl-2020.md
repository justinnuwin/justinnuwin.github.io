This is where I currently work. I started as an [intern at LLNL, click here to learn more about what I did then (and still do now)](/experience/llnl-2017)

In the meantime some of the things I have done so far are:

- Manage data collection, storage, and visualization for the Film Scanning and Re-Analysis Project
- Architect object detection pipeline utilizing spectral analysis, temporal edge tracking, and exposure analysis of images
- Develop image processing GUI tools utilizing TK using Python and OpenCV
- Implement statistical methods to automatically check measurement data for quality
- Building data-driven image processing models to further automate accurate film measurements 

Stay tuned for updates!
