This is where I currently work, stay tuned for updates!

In the meantime some of the things I have done so far are:

- Manage data collection, storage, and visualization for the Film Scanning and Re-Analysis Project
- Architect object detection pipeline utilizing spectral analysis, temporal edge tracking, and exposure analysis of images
- Develop image processing GUI tools utilizing TK using Python and OpenCV
- Implement statistical methods to automatically check measurement data for quality
- Building data-driven image processing models to further automate accurate film measurements
