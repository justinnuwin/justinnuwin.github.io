I was heavily involved in the [Cal Poly CubeSat Lab (PolySat)](https://www.polysat.org) during my undergraduate.
While working there for 4 years, I have worked on many CubeSat missions in a variety of roles throughout various mission lifetimes.
I list out my accomplishmets and various projects below.
I also interned at [JPL, working on the MarCO CubeSat](/experience/jpl-2018) which was highly relavent to my experience at the Cal Poly CubeSat Lab.
