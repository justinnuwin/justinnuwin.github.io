ASR is used heavily in eyes-busy or hands-busy situations and often time the user may be speaking over noise.
My peers and I are particularly interested in how music effects ASR decoding.
We use several music datasets of varied genre or broken-down instrumentation to allow us to perform in-depth anaysis of how different aspects of music influences speech recognizer's performance.
We then train a new model from what we have learned to see if we could improve the original model's performance.
