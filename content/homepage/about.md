**Hi there!** I'm a masters student at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) studying machine learning and how to apply them on embedded and mobile devices both power and time efficiently.
I am currently looking for full-time opportunities anywhere in the world.
I am really passionate about collaborating with others to build amazing things, so browse my [projects](/projects) and feel free to [reach out](#contact)!

Outside of software development and engineering, I love spending time outdoors, playing music, and cooking.
