**Hi there!** My name is Justin and I am currently a masters student at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Program (ECE).
My interests are focused in embedded systems and machine learning and I am studying how we can apply computationally intensive algorithms on resource-constrained embedded and mobile platforms.
I am really passionate about collaborating with others to build amazing things, so browse my [projects](/projects) and feel free to [reach out](#contact)!

**I am currently looking for full-time opportunities!**

Outside of software development and engineering, I love spending time outdoors, __vibing__ to music on my AT turntable, and cooking international dishes!
