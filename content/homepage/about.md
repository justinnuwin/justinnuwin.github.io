**Hi there!** I'm a masters student at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) studying to bring machine learning and modern data processing to embedded and mobile devices.
In addition to my graduate studies, I am also currently a contractor at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory working on computer vision research and workflows and a flight software developer for IRIS, CMU's Lunar Rover. 
I am really passionate about collaborating with others to build amazing things, so browse my [projects](/portfolio) and feel free to [reach out](#contact)!

Outside of software development and engineering, I love spending time outdoors, playing music, and cooking.
