**Hi there!** My name is Justin and I am currently a Software Engineer at Zoox.
My interests are focused in embedded systems, machine learning, and computer architecture.

Outside of software development and engineering, I love spending time outdoors, __vibing__ to 80's jazz fusion music on my AT turntable, and cooking all kinds of international dishes!
