_M.S. Electrical and Computer Engineering_ • May 2020 - May 2021

- Low Power code for IOT: Theory behind designing software (especially RTOS) to take advantage of "dark silicon" on embedded hardware to minimize energy use, thereby maximizing battery life.
- Speech Recognition and Understanding: Study how speech recognition systems model human speech using HMM+GMM, HMM+DNN, and end-to-end models. Implement simple HMM+GMM word recognizer and Listen, Attend, Spell (LAS) speech recognizer.
- Machine Learning for Signal Processing: Theory behind how machine learning can be applied to signal processing applications. Investigation of data driven signal processing approaches and parallels with machine learning techniques.
- Image and Video Processing: Theory and implementation of many popular image processing methods with particular emphasis on sparse approximations and linear inverse problems
- Machine Learning: Theory and implementation of various supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
