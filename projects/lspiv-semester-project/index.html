The USGS measures stream flows since they are critical for long-term tracking and modeling/forecasting to ensure that federal water priorities and responsibilities can be met and that the nation’s rivers canbe effectively managed. Recently, the USGS has been looking at non-contact methods of collection this data which would allow USGS scientists to gather data more safely and possibly without even going in to the field. One such method is large-scale particle image velocimetry (LS-PIV)."><meta name=keywords content="software developer big data big-data bigdata machine learning signal processing python c c++ c/c++ git github computer vision data mangement data-mangement embedded systems architect hardware projects portfolio cubesats satellites space"><meta name=robots content="noodp"><link rel=canonical href=https://www.justinnuwin.com/projects/lspiv-semester-project/><link rel=stylesheet href=https://www.justinnuwin.com/assets/style.css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://www.justinnuwin.com/assets/green.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://www.justinnuwin.com/img/apple-touch-icon-192x192.png><link rel="shortcut icon" href=https://www.justinnuwin.com/img/favicon/green.png><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:site content="@justinnuwin"><meta name=twitter:creator content="How to Write Low Power Code for the IOT Semester Project (CMU 18-747)"><meta property="og:locale" content="en"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="og:title" content="Embedded LS-PIV for Measuring Stream Flows"><meta property="og:description" content="The USGS measures stream flows since they are critical for long-term tracking and modeling/forecasting to ensure that federal water priorities and responsibilities can be met and that the nation’s rivers canbe effectively managed.
