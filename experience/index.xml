I originally interned at LLNL over the summer of 2017 (click hear to learn more about my group), and joined part-time during university to support the software side of the project longer-term. I am continuing to develop vision algorithms for scientific measurements, but I am also working on streamlining our team&amp;rsquo;s workflow by using the latest workflow automation tools like Dagster.
Over the past 2 years working for the Film Scanning and Re-analysis project I have added several new measurement tools to our measurement tool written in Python.</description></item><item><title>Cal Poly CubeSat Lab (PolySat)</title><link>https://www.justinnuwin.com/experience/polysat-2020/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.justinnuwin.com/experience/polysat-2020/</guid><description>I was heavily involved in the Cal Poly CubeSat Lab (PolySat) during my undergraduate. While working there for 4 years, I have worked on many CubeSat missions in a variety of roles throughout various mission lifetimes. I list out my accomplishmets and various projects below. I also interned at JPL, working on the MarCO CubeSat which was highly relavent to my experience at the Cal Poly CubeSat Lab.

The projects I have worked on in this group have been primarily focused towards the security of platoons of autonomous vehicles. Vehicle platoons require extensive communication to stay cohesive and ensure that no collisions occur. The two paradigms that vehicles communicate are vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) using a protocol like DSRC or vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) usually using cellular infrastructure like 4G-LTE and 5G.</description></item><item><title>NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)</title><link>https://www.justinnuwin.com/experience/jpl-2018/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.justinnuwin.com/experience/jpl-2018/</guid><description>After 1.5 years working at the Cal Poly CubeSat Lab I had the opportunity to intern at JPL to operate the MarCO CubeSats. MarCO is a pair of CubeSats that were launched with NASA&amp;rsquo;s InSight Lander with the mission to:
Relay InSight&amp;rsquo;s Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) data back to Earth in real-time Demonstrate the capabilities of the CubeSat form-factor in deep-space applications An interesting aspect of the MarCO mission is the level of involvement required due to systematic constraints on the mission.</description></item><item><title>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</title><link>https://www.justinnuwin.com/experience/llnl-2017/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.justinnuwin.com/experience/llnl-2017/</guid><description>During my first summer at Cal Poly, I interned at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) working on the Film Scanning and Re-Analysis Project headed by nuclear physicist Gregory Spriggs. The goal of the project is to digitize all the nuclear test films before they decay and reanalyze the results, as many of the results from the 1940s through the early 1960s were plagued with guesswork from the manual measurement process.</description></item></channel></rss>
