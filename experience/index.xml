I started as an intern at LLNL, click here to learn more about what I did then (and still do now)
In the meantime some of the things I have done so far are:
Manage data collection, storage, and visualization for the Film Scanning and Re-Analysis Project Architect object detection pipeline utilizing spectral analysis, temporal edge tracking, and exposure analysis of images Develop image processing GUI tools utilizing TK using Python and OpenCV Implement statistical methods to automatically check measurement data for quality Building data-driven image processing models to further automate accurate film measurements Stay tuned for updates!</description></item><item><title>Cal Poly CubeSat Lab (PolySat)</title><link>https://justinnuwin.com/experience/polysat-2020/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://justinnuwin.com/experience/polysat-2020/</guid><description>Electrical Engineer 2016 - 2020

The projects I have worked on in this group have been primarily focused towards the security of platoons of autonomous vehicles. Vehicle platoons require extensive communication to stay cohesive and ensure that no collisions occur. The two paradigms that vehicles communicate are vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) using a protocol like DSRC or vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) usually using cellular infrastructure like 4G-LTE and 5G.</description></item><item><title>NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)</title><link>https://justinnuwin.com/experience/jpl-2018/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://justinnuwin.com/experience/jpl-2018/</guid><description>After 1.5 years working at the Cal Poly CubeSat Lab I had the opportunity to intern at JPL to operate the MarCO CubeSats. MarCO is a pair of CubeSats that were launched with NASA&amp;rsquo;s InSight Lander with the mission to:
Relay InSight&amp;rsquo;s Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) data back to Earth in real-time Demonstrate the capabilities of the CubeSat form-factor in deep-space applications An interesting aspect of the MarCO mission is the level of involvement required due to systematic constraints on the mission.</description></item><item><title>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</title><link>https://justinnuwin.com/experience/llnl-2017/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://justinnuwin.com/experience/llnl-2017/</guid><description>During my first summer at Cal Poly, I interned at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) working on the Film Scanning and Re-Analysis Project headed by nuclear physicist Gregory Spriggs. The goal of the project is to digitize all the nuclear test films before they decay and reanalyze the results, as many of the results from the 1940s through the early 1960s were plagued with guesswork from the manual measurement process.</description></item></channel></rss>
