I&amp;rsquo;m a masters student at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) studying machine learning and how to apply them on embedded and mobile devices both power and time efficiently. I am currently looking for full-time opportunities anywhere in the world. I am really passionate about collaborating with others to build amazing things, so browse my projects and feel free to reach out!
Outside of software development and engineering, I love spending time outdoors, playing music, and cooking.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://www.justinnuwin.com/homepage/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.justinnuwin.com/homepage/contact/</guid><description>Feel free to reach out to me via these platforms:

Electrical and Computer Engineering • May 2020 - May 2021
Low Power code for IOT: Theory behind designing software (especially RTOS) to take advantage of &amp;ldquo;dark silicon&amp;rdquo; on embedded hardware to minimize energy use, thereby maximizing battery life. Speech Recognition and Understanding: Study how speech recognition systems model human speech using HMM+GMM, HMM+DNN, and end-to-end models. Implement simple HMM+GMM word recognizer and Listen, Attend, Spell (LAS) speech recognizer.</description></item><item><title>Skills</title><link>https://www.justinnuwin.com/homepage/skills/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.justinnuwin.com/homepage/skills/</guid><description>Python and packages such as Numpy, Pandas, PyTorch, Keras, and Sklearn C/C++ for desktop and embedded applications with experience with libraries such as OpenCV, Boost, gRPC, ProtoBuf Proficient with machine learning techniques and libraries.
